# Library-Management-System-Project
A library management system (LMS) is a software application specifically developed to oversee and streamline the various operations of a library. It assists librarians in managing the database of new acquisitions, tracking borrowed books, and monitoring due dates for returns. The system ensures efficient record-keeping, reduces manual errors, and improves overall service delivery. By automating tasks such as book checkouts, renewals, and reservations, it enhances library operations, making it easier to keep track of inventory and manage member interactions. Additionally, LMS helps in generating reports, managing fines, and optimizing book availability for library users.
